# Python-Practice-Hashing
# This is my first project on python. A steep learning curve but one that is welcomed.
# My function is to hash a password inputted by the user and display it on the screen.
# I used "FLASK" a python orientated library that can run small based projects such as a web app as seen here.
# Using salt, I was able to hash a password that is input from the user and display it. This hash password is 16 chars long.
# for the purpose of this project i did not implement any form of DB as it was only for testing purposes.
